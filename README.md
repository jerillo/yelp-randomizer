# Yelp Randomizer

**Author: Jesnine Erillo**

Have you ever spent hours trying to figure out what restaurant you want to eat at? Me too!

My friends and I always spend so much time just trying to decide on where to go, so this simplifies that thought process by making a decision for us! :)

This application randomly selects a business given a search query using the Yelp Fusion API and Flask.

Deployed on Heroku! View [live website](https://yelp-randomizer.herokuapp.com/).

## Running Locally

1. Create a Yelp app to retrieve your API Key: [https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)
2. Enter your private API Keys into `.env.example` and rename the file to `.env`
3. Run `python3 app.py`
